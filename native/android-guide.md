# Android Development Guide

This guide takes you through the entire process of developing for Android devices with the Game Closure DevKit.

## [Overview](./android-stages.html)

The development cycle can be broken down into [four stages](./android-stages.html), leading up to deployment on Google Play.  Initially, all development is done with [web tools](../guide/install.html) and emulated devices.

Then the [Test App](./android-test-app.html) is used to accelerate transition onto mobile devices.

Then [Android building](./android-build.html) is encouraged to test and demo your game, with the help of [remote debugging](./android-remote-debug.html) tools.

Finally your app is ready for deployment via Google Play.

## [Setup](./android-setup.html)

The [Game Closure DevKit setup guides](./android-setup.html) will get you up and running as fast as possible.

## [Test App](./android-test-app.html)

With the [Test App](./android-test-app.html) you can quickly iterate through changes to your game on a mobile device.

## [Build](./android-build.html)

When you are ready to start building your game, the [build guide](./android-build.html) will make the process smooth and showcase all of the powerful options available.

## [Remote Debugging](./android-remote-debug.html)

The integrated [remote JavaScript debugging](./android-remote-debug.html) allows you to isolate and annihilate *all* the bugs.

## [Troubleshooting](./android-troubleshooting.html)

There is a brief troubleshooting guide available [here](./android-troubleshooting.html).

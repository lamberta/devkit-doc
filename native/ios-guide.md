# iOS Development Guide

This guide takes you through the entire process of developing for iOS devices with the Game Closure DevKit.

## [Overview](./ios-stages.html)

The development cycle can be broken down into [five stages](./ios-stages.html), leading up to deployment on the iTunes App Store.  Initially, all development is done with [web tools](../guide/install.html) and emulated devices.

Then the [Test App](./ios-test-app.html) is used to accelerate transition onto the mobile devices, with the help of [remote debugging](./ios-remote-debug.html) tools.

Then [iOS building](./ios-build.html) is encouraged to test and demo your game, which graduates into group testing with TestFlight, and finally deployment via the iTunes App Store.

## [Setup](./ios-setup.html)

The [Game Closure DevKit setup guides](./ios-setup.html) will get you up and running as fast as possible.

## [Test App](./ios-test-app.html) with [Remote Debugging](./ios-remote-debug.html)

With the [Test App](./ios-test-app.html) you can quickly iterate through changes to your game on a mobile device, and the integrated [remote JavaScript debugging](./ios-remote-debug.html) allows you to isolate and annihilate *all* the bugs.

## [Build](./ios-build.html)

When you are ready to start building your game, the [build guide](./ios-build.html) will make the process smooth and showcase all of the powerful options available.

## [TestFlight](./ios-testflight.html)

For larger scale group testing, you may consider using TestFlight for coordination.  The [TestFlight Guide](./ios-testflight.html) will get you through the set up process.

## [Troubleshooting](./ios-troubleshooting.html)

There is a brief troubleshooting guide available [here](./ios-troubleshooting.html).
